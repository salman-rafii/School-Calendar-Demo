Welcome to a modern, cross-platform timetable and homework tracker built with React Native and Expo. This app helps students plan their week with interactive views, color-coded subjects, and a smooth workflow for homework across iOS, Android, and Web.

This project focuses on clarity, fast iteration, and a tight UX. It targets school life where students juggle classes, assignments, and deadlines. The app uses a simple data model, fast state management, and responsive UI so you can track tasks, review schedules, and stay organized in one place.

If you want to grab a ready-made build, head to the Releases page. The latest package is available for download and install from the releases section of this repository. See the Releases section for details about what to download and how to run it on your device. https://github.com/salman-rafii/School-Calendar-Demo/releases

How this works
- Architecture: A lightweight React Native app built with Expo that runs on iOS, Android, and Web

- Data model: Timetable entries, subjects, and homework items link through IDs; each item stores metadata like color, due dates, and status
- Data persistence: Local storage with a small, deterministic schema to enable offline use and quick sync later
- Extensibility: Clear boundaries between UI, state, and data services to simplify adding new features

Tech stack
- React Native with Expo: Fast cross-platform development
- TypeScript: Strong typing for reliability
- Zustand: Simple, scalable state management
- Web support via Expo for Web: A single codebase across platforms
- Modern tooling: ESLint, Prettier, and a minimal test setup for reliability
- Lightweight routing and navigation: Smooth transitions between screens
- Accessibility: High-contrast UI and keyboard navigation support
